# AI Skills — 66+ Lean Domain Skills for Claude Code, Cursor, Codex & Beyond

> **66+ focused skills.** Skills come in three formats: (1) core skills using the standard template — Identity → Stack Defaults → Decision Framework → Anti-Patterns → Quality Gates (~75 lines); (2) Android/platform reference skills — full implementation guides with working code patterns; (3) third-party vendor skills with their own YAML schema (e.g. Google, Azure). Dense enough to be useful, lean enough not to bloat your context window.

## Why This Collection?

Skills load into your AI's context window on every invocation. Bloated skills waste tokens and dilute focus. This library is optimized for **signal density**:

| | Before (v1) | After (v2) |
|--|-------------|------------|
| Files | 47 (35 skills + 12 "super agents") | 65+ skills |
| Total lines | 19,207 | 2,531 |
| Est. tokens (full load) | ~240,000 | ~37,000 |
| Avg lines/skill | ~400 | 72 |
| Tokens per invocation | ~3,700 | ~1,050 |

**−87% lines. −84% tokens per invocation.** Same decision quality — the template forces every skill to include if/then decision rules, anti-patterns, and quality gates rather than prose explanations.

Every skill answers three questions: *What tool/approach?* (Stack Defaults), *When and why?* (Decision Framework), *What to avoid?* (Anti-Patterns).

## Quick Install

```bash
# Full collection
git clone https://github.com/drewid74/ai_skills.git ~/.claude/skills/ai_skills

# Or cherry-pick individual skills
cp -r ai_skills/docker-selfhost ~/.claude/skills/
```

Works with Claude Code, Cursor, Codex CLI, Windsurf, and any tool that reads `SKILL.md` files.

## Skill Template

Every skill follows the same structure (~75 lines):

```markdown
---
name: skill-name
description: "Use this when: [action/problem phrases ≤20, intent-first]"
---

## Identity
You [role]. [Core principle]. Never [hard constraint].

## Stack Defaults
| Layer | Choice | Why |

## Decision Framework
### When to X
- If [condition] → [action]

## Anti-Patterns
| Don't | Why | Do Instead |

## Quality Gates
- [ ] Gate
```

Descriptions use **action/problem phrases** ("my pipeline is failing", "set up CI") rather than tool names — this is how the routing system finds the right skill for natural-language prompts.

---

## What Makes These Different

**Decision density over prose.** Every skill has explicit if/then decision rules and an anti-patterns table. The LLM gets *when to use X vs Y* — not just *what X is*.

**Context-efficient.** At ~1,050 tokens per skill invocation (down from ~3,700), these load fast and leave room for your actual code in the context window.

**Universal, not personal.** Placeholders (`<NAS_IP>`, `<API_KEY>`, `<POOL_NAME>`) throughout. No hardcoded infrastructure — patterns that work across any setup.

---

## Skill Anatomy

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md    # Required: YAML frontmatter + ~75 lines of structured instructions
└── scripts/    # Optional: helper scripts referenced in SKILL.md
```

The YAML frontmatter controls when the skill auto-invokes:

```yaml
---
name: docker-selfhost
description: "Use this when: my container keeps restarting, set up a self-hosted service,
  my volumes are not persisting, deploy with Docker Compose, my container won't start"
---
```

Descriptions use **intent phrases** ("my container keeps restarting") not tool names ("Docker, Compose, volumes"). The routing is semantic — natural-language problem descriptions match better than keyword lists.

## Contributing

Skills are plain markdown with a fixed template. The bar is **one skill, ~75 lines**:

1. Fork the repo
2. Create `your-skill-name/SKILL.md` using this structure:
   - `## Identity` — role + core principle + hard constraint (3 lines)
   - `## Stack Defaults` — 4–8 row table: Layer | Choice | Why
   - `## Decision Framework` — 2–4 if/then sections with `→` bullets
   - `## Anti-Patterns` — 4–6 row table: Don't | Why | Do Instead
   - `## Quality Gates` — 4–6 checkboxes
3. Write the description as action/problem phrases: `"Use this when: my X is broken, set up Y, how do I Z"`
4. Open a PR with 2–3 example prompts that trigger your skill

**Quality bar:** Does it have real if/then decision rules? Does the anti-patterns table catch the top mistakes? Would a developer trust it at 2am during an incident? If yes, it belongs here.
